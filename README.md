# Machine-Learning-I---project
This repository includes codes of our final project for the Machine Learning I course at the University of Warsaw. The project included:
* building a regression model explaining the weight of the newborn child based on the _newborns_ dataset,
* building a classification model explaining whether a particular person closed the credit card account based on the _client_attrition_ dataset.
Both datasets were provided during the course.
